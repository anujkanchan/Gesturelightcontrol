# Gesturelightcontrol
This project enables contactless control of a light using real-time hand gestures detected by a camera. It uses MediaPipe and OpenCV to recognize gestures like an open palm (light ON) and a fist (light OFF), and controls a relay-connected light via Raspberry Pi GPIO.  ðŸ’¡ Ideal for smart homes, hospitals, and accessible environments.
